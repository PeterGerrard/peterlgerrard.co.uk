Over the past few weeks I have been reworking my website, in the aim of actually getting back to posting. And part of this includes making personal backlog available publiclly online.
I haven't added a link to it from the nav bar or similar, but you can find it [here](/learning-backlog/). And its split based off the fairly simple split of todo, doing done where I can move items as I look at them and can update to add more information.

## Why?

I have been using a trello board in the past to help track things I wanted to learn, but generally found that it was best to clear it out so I didn't have anything I could go back and review,
so I decided to put it on my website for several reasons:
- I can store it in git, and get the benefits of source control
- I can point people (and myself) at it to show what I have learnt and my brief (or sometimes more in depth) thoughts.

## Defining an learning backlog item

First I assume I've got the current model wrong, but its in git, I can try to fix it and revert if necessary. But I've started with a few simple elements:
- Title
  - A short introduction to the idea
- Category
  - Have I done, or want to do it
- Resources
  - A collection of links to external resources I found useful, or want to try, and others might too
- Details
  - Before I've looked into it, the types of things I want to focus on
  - During, if its a long running thing will be my running thoughts (very likely to change)
  - Afterwards, I will fill this in wioth my brief opinions. If I need more space then it will become a link to a full blog post
  
## Lifecycle of a learning backlog item

If I hear a cool idea, or somehow else get an idea of something to look at it will go as a very brief item into the uncategorised section of interested.
Periodically I will review the uncategorised items and eithe delete it or move into into upcomining. At this point I will also add any first thoughts on particulars I want to look at.
When I run out of next items I will review the upcoming and choose the next few to be promoted to next items. This is the last point I will delete an item.

And when I want something to learn I will pick the next item, move into doing. This will be kept up to date with my ongoing thoughts and resources I am using. When I am happy with my current knowledge level on the subject it will move into done, with a refined version of my opinions and resources.

Repeat

## What next

- Get the backlog as a link available elsewhere on the site
- Make the github repo public so people can review it there if they prefer (my current design could denitley do with some work)
- Improve the design of the backlog so its generally more usable, but I'll find out exactly the issues as it gets used
