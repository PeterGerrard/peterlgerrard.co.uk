details: Components (in particular Component libraries) are a great way to build in accessibility. I can have my image require you specify an alt text rather than hoping you remember to add one. But its not all sunshine and rainbows, whilst I make it easier to re-use components and reduce repition of elements it is easy to break accessibility features through the liberal use of extraneous html tags only there for layout. But by being disciplined this can be avoided, and you should use React Fragments (https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#semantic-html), css grid (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVeCqQCxlk) and other techniques to keep the html semantically correct.
