  This ended up being quite a long running project that touched on many things:
    - Istio and service meshes
    - Kind/Minikube, how to do local development. Even looked a bit at Azure Dev Spaces
    - Micro frontends and how to create a single UI from multiple services
    - Helm and how to update kubernetes
    - Database Deployments
  As well as implementing the above I also thought about but never implemented:
    - Dependency Inversion of services, and how each service should not rely on the existence of others
