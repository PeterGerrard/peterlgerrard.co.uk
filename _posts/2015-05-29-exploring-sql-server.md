At Redgate we have a thrice yearly event, Down Tools Week. During which everyone has the choice not to work on their normal project but instead can work on another project of their own choosing. In the last Down Tools Week I chose to spend the time getting to know SQL Server.

### Why did I do this?
Quite simply, Redgate works on products that look at SQL Server databases and I felt I had an insufficient understanding of SQL Server specifics. It felt like a good idea to spend a week focused solely on improving my knowledge.

### What did I do?
Firstly I went and found some useful video tutorials on SQL Server and watched them. The best place I found for these (it was free which helped) was Microsoft Virtual Academy. I started with a refresher on SQL skills and ended with a how to administer a SQL Server. Whilst I did not go into full depth on any subject, which was never the intention, I did get a passing knowledge of many different areas.

### What did I get out of it?
The main thing was a broadening of my database knowledge and a better understanding of where to go for more information. But what was this knowledge if I didn’t have some way of easily accessing the knowledge, either for myself or someone who doesn’t want to try and sift through any technical details but just wants broad strokes. So the final thing I did during Down Tools Week was to choose several areas to break down into business card sized cheat sheets.

I mainly picked areas which I had previously heard questions about and would not have been able to answer easily. The next few posts will be going through some of these sets of cards.
